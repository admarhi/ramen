\arguments{
\item{g}{An igraph object. Must be a directed graph.}

\item{source_x}{Numeric scalar. The x-coordinate for source nodes.
Defaults to 0.}

\item{mixed_x}{Numeric scalar. The central x-coordinate for intermediate
nodes. The actual layout spans \code{mixed_x} +/- 0.4. Defaults to 1.}

\item{sink_x}{Numeric scalar. The x-coordinate for sink nodes. Defaults to 2.}

\item{vertical_spacing}{Numeric scalar. The maximum y-coordinate, controlling
the vertical spread of the layout. Defaults to 1.}

\item{vertex_size}{Numeric scalar. The size of the vertices (nodes) in the
plot. Defaults to 10.}

\item{vertex_label_cex}{Numeric scalar. The character expansion factor for
vertex labels. Defaults to 0.8.}

\item{edge_arrow_size}{Numeric scalar. The size of the arrows on the edges.
Defaults to 0.5.}

\item{edge_width_range}{Numeric vector of length 2. The minimum and maximum
width for edges when scaled by weight. If the graph is unweighted or all
weights are identical, the mean of this range is used. Defaults to
\code{c(0.1, 0.1)}.}

\item{color_edges_by_weight}{Logical scalar.
If \code{TRUE} and the graph has a
'weight' edge attribute, edges will be colored based on their weight,
interpolating between \code{edge_color_low} and \code{edge_color_high}.}

\item{edge_color_low}{Character string. The color for the lowest edge weight
when \code{color_edges_by_weight} is \code{TRUE}. Defaults to "gray80".}

\item{edge_color_high}{Character string. The color for the highest edge
weight when \code{color_edges_by_weight} is \code{TRUE}. Defaults to "black".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to igraph.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. This function is called for its
side effect of generating a plot.

\description{
Arranges nodes of a directed graph into three distinct columns representing
sources (nodes with only outgoing edges), sinks (nodes with only incoming
edges), and intermediate nodes (with both incoming and outgoing edges).
The layout within the intermediate column is determined using the
Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm. This visualization helps understand the
overall flow structure within the graph.
