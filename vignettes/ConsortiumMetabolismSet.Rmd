## \code{ConsortiumMetabolismSet} Class

A MFS can be created by uniting any number of MF objects together by calling ConsortiumMetabolismSet() or MFS() on either a list of MF objects or inidividual MF objects. This process it self does not trigger any processing of the data, the only thing that happens is that metadata of the MFS is calculated and an UUID is generated. If upon creation, the mode of alignment is already known it can be supplied to the constructor function of the MF as follows: ConsortiumMetabolismSet(â€¦, alignment="multiple")

## ToDo
- Inherit the MF class and methods
- Write `removeMF()` and `addMF()` functions
